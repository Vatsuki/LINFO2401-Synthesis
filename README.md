All credits go to our teacher Lionel Dricot.

**Current status :**

- A lot of work is still required. It contains all the content from the md files in the "syllabus" section and all my personal notes taken during lectures.
- It still contains a lot of my raw notes, sometimes in french and "franglais" with a lot of typos. So there is a bunch of rewriting to do.
- Some text is redundant and might be placed in inadequate sections. I tried to structure everything we talked about but that was not an easy task ^^'
- I have other exams to study for, so it's highly likely that I will not be making modifications (you can though). 


**Why I made this :**
I like this class, I like the teacher but the course is really messy. 


**How I made this :**
With TeXstudio (Flatpak). TeXstudio is an integrated writing environment for creating LaTeX documents. It integrates editing, building and viewing into a single, user-friendly interface.


**Notes for contribution :**
I will sometime check if there is PRs. I think to make it simpler, focus your contribution on one section at a time. Avoid a big restructurating impacting the whole document because I don't really want to check everything at once.
So make several small and focused contributions rather than a huge one.

If you want to make a big rework of everything, you are free to do your own fork ;)
